# Emotional Experience Brain Cleanse  

I just had an odd experience.

I've been feeling 'brain fogged' as I didn't get enough sleep last night.

I've been feeling that way all day. It has been annoying to say the least.

I just watched a video which I found emotionally touching.

The art was beautiful, but that isn't the point.

Immediately after the emotional reaction (which bordered on physical. One of those 'tinglingly deep' reactions one sometimes has with exceptional art) I suddenly was no longer brain fogged.

I suspect this is some hormonal reaction similar to how serotonin works (perhaps indeed it was serotonin itself at work?). Maybe just a dash of adrenaline? I have no clue.

I had never before thought of _using_ art as a sort of short-burst medical theropy. Like one would use Tylenol to fix a minor physical pain.

Yet that was exactly the kind of response I just had.

I thought I would share and see if this is 'a thing'.

TLDR; I've always viewed art as more of a meaningful/pleasurable experience kind of thing. Now I'm considering how I might more intentionally _use_ art, as one would use a mental tool or drug.
