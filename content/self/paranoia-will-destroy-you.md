# Paranoia Will Destroy You

AWS us-west-2 (oregan) [went down yesterday (Sept 28th 2022)](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status). Not totally, but enough for me to have a bad day.


## The (Back) Story
I noticed the AWS issues at first by a slow down. Then odd failures as I was pushing up image-based Lambda Functions I was testing out. I assumed it was my code, which is 99.995% of the time the correct assumption.

When one is in the middle of development the last thing one wants is shaky ground beneath one's feet.

One needs to _trust_ that the world is sane, because one is diving deep and needs to focus.

So yesterday was particularly frustrating, as one of the _bedrocks_ of my development became fractured. It was one of the last conclusions for me to reach, as I went about investigating the culprit of my problems. It didn't help that it was a _deployment_ problem which caused increased time delays as I 'dev-looped' modifying things to try to fix the problem.

I eventually reached the point where I had to stop development as I could make no further progress.

## Lesson: Trust WILL BE (L)EARNED

Today I no longer trust AWS to the degree I did before. It is going to take days and weeks of consistent problem-free usssage for me to stop checking the AWS health status when I have an issue. Trust takes time to be re-earned.

This Unfortunate as paranoia has a cognitive, stress, and time cost.

I _need_ to trust, so I eventually _will_ trust, as the complexity is more than I can handle otherwise. It is inefficient and takes too much effort to remain in a heightened state of paranoia.

## Lesson: Balanced (Dis)trust

Like many things there is no 'right' level of paranoia. It is a constant adjustment. One can only get better at _balancing_.

I have such trust in most things, I don't even _notice_ my surroundings most of the time. My brain's job in many ways is to _filter out_ as much as possible. I don't have enough neurons to spare. Living in an environment I can trust is a key to success. It isn't just _comfortable_ it is _vital_.

Building trust therefore _quite important_. Not because it somehow makes the thing more _trustworthy_ but because it means I no longer have to pay attention to it.

## TODO: Actively Build Trust

This experience and my analysis of it has made me come to realize that while trust does indeed 'just happen' with time, I can also influence the game a bit.

I'm begining to see trust as such a vital component to efficiency and productivity that actively working to _build trust_ is worthwhile.

Sort of like going to the gym to build muscles, that aren't _strictly needed_ but never-the-less provide health benefits.

## Summary

Trust matters more than one might think. 

Trust is so important in fact, that taking the time to _build trust_ and to build a _trustworthy environment_ is worth putting serious thought and activity into.

IMHO one _should not_ 'put up with' or otherwise _accept_ a situation where trust is fragile. Either take action to make it better, or move away from an untrustworthy environment.
