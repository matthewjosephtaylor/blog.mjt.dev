# SEO is dead, long live AIO

The last quarter century or so has been the age of the internet, and how to best take advantage of it.

The next period is now the age of AI, and how best to take advantage of it.

It isn't of course that the internet is going way. We still use heat engines. We still use writing. No world-shaping technology ever goes away. But the focus of the world's attention does shift as we find another 'good trick' that we ratchet up on.

Today I rarely if ever use Google, I use ChatGPT to filter down the wealth of the world's knowledge for me. Even for current-time information, as OpenAI has become better at leveraging web-search capabilities via the ChatGPT interface to their LLM models. The AI is a better 'Googler' than I am (though I assume it uses Bing with the Microsoft connection, really I don't care, I just care about results).

I also note that recently I prefer coding styles and libraries that I feel the LLM would understand better. I've begun to pick and choose my technologies based on how well they would work with an AI as a major consideration. I am tailoring my work itself to be more AI friendly.

In other words I interact with AI as the gateway to the world more and more and I'm sure I'm not alone.

To be honest I think this will be a breath of fresh air. Those sources of actual good content and information will be able to rise to the top, and the SEO games will be less and less effective, as 'search' becomes more attuned with genuine quality content as determined by an LLM.

The LLM is in other words is now the gatekeeper not only to the world's knowledge, but also to me. If you want _my_ attention, you need to get past my AI assistant.

The age of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is over, and the age of AIO (Artificial Intelligence Optimization) has begun.

By this I mean that those who seek to get their content in front of people will need to optimize for AI, not for search engines. The AI is the new audience.

I honestly don't know what that looks like. There are no games and tricks that will work for any length of time when the opponent is of ever increasing intelligence. The only way to win is to be genuine, to be real, to be good.

IMHO that was always the way to win, but increasingly it is now the _only_ way to win.

That is a harder game to play, but it is a better game to play.

I do not shed any tears for the end of SEO, and I look forward to our new age forcing all of us to become a better writer, a better thinker, a better person.

I look forward to the results of AIO on our society. It will be a painful process. It is better to start that process today. 

How will you optimize for AI?
